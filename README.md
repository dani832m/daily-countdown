## About

This daily countdown was originally developed for a WooCommerce shop, but can in principle be used in all cases where there is a need for a countdown to a specific time of the day, after which the countdown starts over. The text content is in Danish, but I'm sure your translation skills can handle it ðŸ¤ 

## Getting started

It's super simple to set up the countdown timer for your project. First, change the value in the variable `statedPointInTime` to the desired time. Then add the id `countdown` to the HTML element in which you want the countdown to appear. And... TADAA! ðŸŽ‰
